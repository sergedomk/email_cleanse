email_utils
===========

This package contains a collection of utilities and tools for dealing with
email.

The initial focus of this package is to provide an easy way to normalize
email to a single character encoding. There is nothing preventing email
being sent using several different character encodings. This can be
problematic when you want to archive the email or pubish it to the web.
